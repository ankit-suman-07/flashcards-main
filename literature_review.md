### ***1. The Use of Flashcards in an Introduction to Psychology Class*** [Read Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251573566_The_Use_of_Flashcards_in_an_Introduction_to_Psychology_Class)


#### **Purpose of the Study**

The paper investigates whether **flashcards improve student learning** compared to other study strategies, and how students use them.


#### **Key Findings**

1. **Flashcards as a Common Study Tool**

   * Many students report using flashcards, especially in subjects requiring memorization (psychology, medicine, language learning).
   * They are valued for their simplicity, portability, and flexibility.

2. **Effectiveness**

   * Flashcards promote **active recall** (retrieving information without prompts), which strengthens memory far better than passive review (like rereading notes).
   * They naturally encourage **repetition**, which aids long-term retention.

3. **Comparison With Other Methods**

   * Flashcards tend to be more effective than passive methods like highlighting or rereading.
   * However, their effectiveness depends on how they are used: spaced practice and self-testing yield the best outcomes.

4. **Student Misconceptions**

   * Some students use flashcards incorrectly (e.g., just flipping through them quickly, not testing themselves).
   * Misuse can reduce effectiveness, showing the importance of **proper strategy** (like spacing and testing).


#### **Implications for Learning**

* Flashcards are especially useful when combined with **spaced repetition** and **feedback-based learning**.
* Teachers can encourage students to use flashcards effectively by:

  * Teaching active recall strategies.
  * Highlighting the importance of **deliberate practice** instead of rote memorization.


#### **Conclusions**

* Flashcards are a **powerful, low-tech tool** for learning and memory retention.
* Their success lies not in the tool itself, but in **how learners use them**.
* Proper use (testing, spacing, active recall) makes them one of the most effective study aids.


#### **Takeaway for The Project**:
-   This research validates the idea. If the flashcard app **guides users to use cards effectively** (e.g., by embedding spaced repetition, “Got It/Again/Almost” logic, and progress tracking), it'll be aligning with proven cognitive science — making the product much more valuable and defensible.

### ***2. uToronto - Flashcards*** [Read Here](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/learningstrategies/flashcards)

**Problem**
-   Learners often rely on passive strategies such as rereading, highlighting, or cramming, which are shown to be ineffective for long-term retention. There is a need for simple yet powerful tools that actively engage memory processes and promote deeper learning.

**Findings**

* Flashcards are highly effective because they incorporate **evidence-based learning strategies**, such as:

  * **Retrieval practice** – actively recalling information strengthens memory.
  * **Spaced repetition** – revisiting cards over time improves long-term retention.
  * **Dual coding & visuals** – adding images, cues, and colors enhances understanding.
  * **Chunking** – breaking down material into smaller units reduces cognitive load.
* Proper use of flashcards (small batches, bidirectional testing, focusing on weak cards) is more impactful than merely reviewing notes.
* Tools like **Quizlet, Excel, or handmade cards** help structure this process, but effectiveness depends on learner strategy.

**Implications for the Flashcard App Idea**

* A digital flashcard system that **encourages retrieval, tracks confidence levels, and integrates spaced repetition** directly aligns with proven learning science.
* Features like **“Got it / Almost / Again” sorting, image integration, and shuffling** mirror best practices identified in research.
* Providing structured guidance in-app ensures users avoid common misuse (e.g., rote flipping without testing).

**Validation**: 
-   Research confirms that flashcards are not just a study habit, but a scientifically backed method for learning and retention. Building an app that embeds these strategies into its core design provides strong justification for the project.
