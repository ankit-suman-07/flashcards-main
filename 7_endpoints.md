# ðŸ“Œ Endpoints Mapping (by Entities & Features)

## **Phase 1: Single User App (MVP)**

### User (single-user, so minimal)

* `POST /api/user/register` â†’ Create account (optional in MVP, you can hardcode a single user for testing)
* `POST /api/user/login` â†’ Login and get session/token
* `GET /api/user/profile` â†’ Get user details (decks, playlists, stats)

### Deck

* `POST /api/decks` â†’ Create a new deck

## **Phase 2: Image Support for Cards**

### Card Enhancements

* `POST /api/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/image` â†’ Upload image for card
* `GET /api/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/image` â†’ Fetch image
* `DELETE /api/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/image` â†’ Remove image

## **Phase 3: Multi-User + Sharing**

### User

* `GET /api/users` â†’ (Admin only) list users
* `PUT /api/user/:userId` â†’ Update user profile
* `DELETE /api/user/:userId` â†’ Delete user

### Sharing

* `POST /api/decks/:deckId/share` â†’ Share deck with another user
* `POST /api/playlists/:playlistId/share` â†’ Share playlist with another user
* `GET /api/decks/shared-with-me` â†’ Get decks shared with me
* `GET /api/playlists/shared-with-me` â†’ Get playlists shared with me

## **Phase 4: AI Features**

* `POST /api/ai/cards/generate` â†’ Upload PDF/text, AI creates cards
* `GET /api/ai/cards/status/:jobId` â†’ Track job status (in case async generation)

# ðŸ“Œ Mapping to Features

| Requirement                             | Endpoint(s)                                                            | Notes                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Create decks/cards                      | `/api/decks`, `/api/decks/:deckId/cards`                               | Core CRUD                         |
| Revision flow (Got It / Almost / Again) | `/api/decks/:deckId/revision/...`                                      | Handles spaced repetition logic   |
| Image upload                            | `/api/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/image`                               | Use cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary) |
| Multi-user                              | `/api/user/*`, `/api/decks/shared-with-me`, `/api/decks/:deckId/share` | Requires auth & ACLs              |
| AI card generation                      | `/api/ai/cards/generate`                                               | Can be async (queue-based)        |

ðŸ‘‰ This gives a **clean separation**:

* CRUD endpoints (basic entity management)
* Revision endpoints (business logic)
* Sharing endpoints (multi-user)
* AI endpoints (extension features)
