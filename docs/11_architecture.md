Got it 🚀 Since you’re targeting **Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + React (TypeScript)** with phases (MVP → AI → Sharing), we’ll design an architecture that is **clear, professional, and portfolio-ready**. Here’s what you can use in your `architecture.md` file:

# 🏗️ Flashcard Learning App — System Architecture

## 1. **High-Level Overview**

The Flashcard App follows a **Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Data)** with a **RESTful API backend** and a **React/TypeScript frontend**. The design ensures **modularity, scalability, and alignment with industry practices**.

* **Frontend (React + TypeScript)** → Provides the user interface (deck management, card revision, progress dashboard). Deployed on Vercel/Netlify.
* **Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)** → Exposes REST APIs for all core features. Handles authentication, business logic, and communication with the database. Deployed on Heroku/Render.
* **Database (PostgreSQL)** → Stores structured data (users, decks, cards, progress, playlists).
* **Cache Layer (Redis – future use)** → For session storage and fast retrieval of revision progress.
* **File Storage (Cloudinary/S3)** → Stores images/media attached to cards.
* **External Services (Phase 4)** → OpenAI API for AI-based card generation, pdf-parse for document ingestion.

## 2. **Backend Architecture (Layered)**

```
src/
│── config/         # Environment configs, DB connection
│── routes/         # API route definitions
│── controllers/    # Handle HTTP requests/responses
│── services/       # Business logic (spaced repetition, validation, sharing)
│── models/         # Database models (using Prisma/TypeORM)
│── middleware/     # JWT auth, error handling, validation
│── utils/          # Helper functions (date utils, file uploads, etc.)
│── jobs/           # Background jobs (AI generation, reminders)
│── tests/          # Unit & integration tests
```

* **Routes** → Map REST endpoints to controllers.
* **Controllers** → Accept requests, validate inputs, delegate to services.
* **Services** → Contain business logic (card scheduling, status updates).
* **Models** → Define database schema (users, decks, cards, card\_progress).
* **Middleware** → JWT authentication, input validation, error handling.
* **Jobs** → Asynchronous workers (AI card generation, reminder notifications).

---

## 3. **Database Schema (Core Entities)**

* **users** → authentication, preferences, gamification stats.
* **decks** → collection of cards, owned by user, visibility flags.
* **cards** → question/answer, media, bidirectionality, optional AI hints.
* **card\_progress** → per-user status & spaced repetition scheduling.
* **playlists/collections** → group multiple decks.
* **revision\_sessions & revision\_attempts** → track study activity.
* **ai\_jobs** → track background AI-based card generation.

---

## 4. **Data Flow (Example: Revision Mode)**

1. User clicks **Start Revision** in frontend.
2. Frontend calls `GET /decks/:deckId/revision` → Backend starts session.
3. Backend fetches cards from DB, applies **spaced repetition logic**, and returns first card.
4. User submits answer (`POST /revision/:sessionId/answer`).
5. Backend updates `card_progress` with new status (`got-it`, `almost`, `again`) and calculates next review date.
6. Backend returns the **next card** until session ends.
7. Progress stats are aggregated and displayed on frontend dashboards.

## 5. **Deployment Architecture**

```
[ User Browser ]
       │
       ▼
[ React + TS (Vercel/Netlify) ]
       │
       ▼
[ Node.js + Express API (Heroku/Render) ]
       │
       ▼
[ PostgreSQL (Cloud DB) ]   [ Redis (cache) ]   [ Cloudinary/S3 (images) ]
       │
       ▼
[ OpenAI API / PDF Parser ] (Phase 4: AI features)
```

---

## 6. **Scalability Considerations**

* **Stateless backend** → can scale horizontally using Docker containers.
* **PostgreSQL indexing** → optimize queries for large decks/cards.
* **Redis cache** → reduce load for repeated queries and session lookups.
* **Async job queue** → for AI generation, reminders, notifications.
* **Microservice split (future)** → AI service and analytics can be separated if traffic grows.

---

## 7. **Tech Decisions Justification**

* **Node.js + Express** → Lightweight, fast, and highly used in Canadian/US job markets.
* **PostgreSQL** → Relational structure fits flashcards and user progress perfectly.
* **React + TypeScript** → Job-market dominant frontend stack, strong typing reduces bugs.
* **Cloudinary/S3** → Simplifies media handling without reinventing storage.
* **JWT** → Industry-standard authentication for multi-user support.
* **Docker + GitHub Actions** → Smooth CI/CD pipeline for professional deployments.
